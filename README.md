# New Repository Template

This template contains all of our basic files for a new GitHub repository. There is also a handy workflow that will create an issue on a new repository made from this template, with a checklist for the steps we usually take in setting up a new repository.

If you're starting a Node.JS project with TypeScript, we have a [specific template](https://github.com/naomi-lgbt/nodejs-typescript-template) for that purpose.
